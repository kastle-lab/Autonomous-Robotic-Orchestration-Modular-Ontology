## Deliverables

The deliverables are structured as follows.

1. **Use-Case** \
   Contains the narrative of our use case and motivation for the research, along with the initially formulated competency questions (CQs) and available datasets.
2. **Key-Notions** \
   Contains the identified concepts that overlapped with the CQs and the available data. Each key notion has a brief description of the rationale, potential existing patterns for reuse, and applicable datasets.
3. **Patterns** \
   This directory includes the schema diagrams for each constructed pattern along with the final schema.
4. **Documentation.md** \
   The final document summarizing the entire class project.
5. **Protege** \
   Contains OWL file with the axioms applied using the Protege software. \
